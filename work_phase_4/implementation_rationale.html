                    <p class="journey-intro">
                        To ensure the website is inclusive and accessible to a
                        wide range of users, we actively applied accessibility
                        and ethical design principles throughout the development
                        process. One key step involved using the IBM Equal
                        Access Accessibility Checker to identify and resolve
                        issues that did not meet WCAG standards‚Äîparticularly
                        those related to contrast ratios and keyboard
                        navigability (tabbable elements). By addressing these
                        issues, we significantly improved the site's
                        accessibility, making it more inclusive for users with
                        different needs and abilities. The comparison images
                        below clearly demonstrate this improvement: after
                        optimization, the number of flagged issues decreased
                        substantially. Most of the remaining alerts are related
                        to invisible or non-interactive elements, which do not
                        impact user experience. This process reflects our
                        commitment to inclusivity and ethical web development
                        practices.

                            <p>
                                Beyond automated tools like the IBM
                                Accessibility Checker, we implemented several
                                hands-on strategies to maximize accessibility.
                                This includes adding alt descriptions to all
                                meaningful images, designing logical tab
                                navigation for key components such as the
                                navigation bar, and ensuring that hidden
                                elements do not disrupt keyboard flow. For
                                example, the activity page includes a viewer
                                that remains hidden until triggered; special
                                care was taken to prevent keyboard users from
                                inadvertently accessing its contents when it is
                                not visible. We also ensured compliance with
                                WCAG 3.2.3 ‚Äî Consistent Navigation ‚Äî by
                                maintaining a stable and predictable interface
                                across all pages.

                                    consent before being processed or displayed.
                                    Additionally, submission forms are designed
                                    with built-in preview features, allowing
                                    users to see how their input will appear
                                    before finalizing it. This ensures
                                    transparency and supports informed
                                    decision-making, reflecting our commitment
                                    to user trust and ethical interaction
                                    design.

                                One of the most significant changes from the A3
                                proposal is the redesign of the navigation bar.
                                Compared to the initial concept, the implemented
                                version greatly improves both interactivity and
                                visual appeal, contributing to a more positive
                                visceral reaction from users. The new design
                                also better reflects the website‚Äôs intended
                                tone, as defined in A3, aligning closely with
                                the playfulness value by offering a more
                                engaging and energetic user experience.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Another major adjustment involved reworking the
                                button styles. To maintain consistency with the
                                website‚Äôs playful and inclusive tone, we
                                replaced many of the grayscale, document-style
                                buttons with colorful theme-based ones.
                                Additionally, the disabled state color was
                                changed from dark red to grey. This change was
                                made because dark red conveyed a sense of
                                urgency or error, which conflicted with the
                                community‚Äôs welcoming and supportive atmosphere.

                                Smaller but meaningful changes were also made to
                                elements like form components. These adjustments
                                were introduced to enhance preview
                                functionality, allowing users to better
                                visualize their submissions before posting. The
                                forms were also optimized for responsiveness,
                                ensuring smooth and intuitive use across
                                different screen sizes.

                                The biggest challenge I faced during
                                implementation was the mismatch between the
                                website‚Äôs design needs and the limitations of
                                the available backend API. For instance, there
                                was no method to send a request to delete
                                outdated or test data, resulting in unnecessary
                                data clutter. Additionally, certain essential
                                features‚Äîsuch as the ability to post a comment
                                directly under a discussion topic‚Äîwere not
                                available in the API‚Äôs public documentation or
                                community resources.

                            <h3>Strategies</h3>
                            <p>
                                To work around these constraints, I developed a
                                set of data processing and identification
                                techniques that allowed me to make the most of
                                the API‚Äôs capabilities. For example, when
                                uploading chat data, I stored the relevant topic
                                ID within the message itself, effectively
                                linking the message to its topic and allowing it
                                to function as a comment. Similarly, avatar
                                image URLs could be fetched from the account
                                list and embedded directly into text fields
                                using string concatenation with a custom
                                delimiter. This eliminated the need for a
                                separate image storage field, optimizing
                                performance. I also used specific markers in
                                data entries to help filter out unwanted or
                                temporary content, reducing interference from
                                test data and improving data cleanliness
                                overall.
